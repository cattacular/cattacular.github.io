Turns out robots make pretty good actors!


This first film was inspired by the concept of an "Automated Ouiji Board" 
Its a bit of a perplexing idea isn't it? We typically dont mix the spiritual world with our technology. It seems on some level the ideas oppose each other. Automating a Ouiji Board also just seems a bit dangerous, I mean, how are you supposed to say goodbye? 
On the other hand though, on some level Ouiji Boards have always been somewhat autonomous. Thats is the point isnt it? It give control to the ghost so they can speak through you.
Anyways, enjoy this lighthearted video.

This next clip was made exploring making films with a robot arm. A bit of a tricky proccess, since making this project programming these arms has gotten much easier. We use it here to hold the camera and to get stable movement. Godzilla was added in post of course.
