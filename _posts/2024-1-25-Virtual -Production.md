Short film made using virtual production.

"Virtual production is a filmmaking method that combines digital and physical elements to create movies, using technologies like computer-generated imagery (CGI), motion capture, and augmented reality. This approach allows filmmakers to create realistic environments and effects in real-time, enhancing creative control and efficiency during production."

In simpler terms virtual production is very similar to using a green screen. Except the green screen acts more like a window
- It produces its own light
- The actors can see the final result live, like looking out a window. Instead of effects being created in post.
- when we move the camera in real life, the background moves with us. Fulling simulating the paralax effect.

The goal of this project was to 
- get more familiar with virtual production as a technique
- Make digital worlds/rigs for practical use
- and to have fun coolaborating

Demanding results was a shortfilm made by Sam Rice and myself. My role in the project was to make sure the virtual production technology was working well, as well as creating all the digital backgrounds. The film is about working in a late stage capitalistic world.
