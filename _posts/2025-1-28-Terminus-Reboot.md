Terminus was the capstone of my Emerging Media Arts Bachelors degree. It's a first person stealth/puzzle shooter taking place on a giant arctic monorail. The project started during our senior year, with us having the summer before to put together the proposal.
I was actually the last person to join the Terminus team. My capstone was originally going to be a scale 3D model of the CEMA building. Then informed by a survey of students, I would design a speculative future for the building. Alas when I was invited to join Terminus, I didnt hesitate to join. Especially since I was friends with all 3 of its members. 
 - Harry Strong  - Director & Unreal Engine Whizz
 - Say Wa        - Lead 3D modeler & Texturer
 - Caleb Kirilov - Sound & Set Design

I joined as the Level Designer & builder. Offering some of my 3D modeling skills as well.
We worked on the project for the whole year culminating in a live showcase of 1 level of our game. Displayed in arcade cabinets we put together ourselves. The final showing was by far my favorite part of the expeience, we got in costume and everything. Caleb had prepared the rest of the set to be like a retro living room. 
We took a vertical slice approach, opposed the also very common, minimum viable product approach. A "Vertical Slice" is when a developement team takes a small section of a game. Usuallly just one level or scene, and polishes it to completion.
Whereas a minimum viable product would be looking at the scope of the whole game, and trying to make it playable begining to end. Then going back and adding artistic details.

Rumor has it that developement may be continuing in the future...
