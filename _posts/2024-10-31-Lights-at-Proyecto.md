I handled live lights for the Halloween show at El Proyecto for many lovely local musicians.


This was an amazing show. There isn't too much to say about my role in things. I manned the light board and controlled Color & brightness of the lights. Most of the pictures I captured are very pink but the lights were typically slowly changing outside of a couple faster ques. I did end up getting quite a few complements on the lights specifically which felt great! Its always good to know the performers are enjoying whats going on.
