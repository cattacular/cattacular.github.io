 I love the accessibility of Bitsy games. Its cool to see what you can come up with in such a constrained environment. Finally awake is the first game I've made in bitsy.
 Its themed off of my phytoria world building. Another project I've been working on for years at this point. Eventually there will be a post for it specifically. The goal of the worldbuilding was to have a narrative foundation to my work in various mediums. Like concept art of my own world.


In "finally awake" you play as someone from the old world. You seem to be the 2nd one to have woken up. before long you come across the remains of one of your own. Right now the game is only a demo of what it could be, ending after the skeleton encounter.
