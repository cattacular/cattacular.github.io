I had the pleasure of completing a project the UNL Bee Lab has been thinking about for nearly a full decade. Partnering with Schramm Education Center, I created a live stream of their indoor bumble bee coloney. 

While normally something like this isnt all that complicated. You just have to get an IP camera talking to OBS, than get OBS talking to a youtube live stream. Alas we had an epic struggle with goverment level firewalls. There was a lot of back and forth with their tech guy, who had to contact someone even higher to make the changes. Just like with most games of telephone, things tend to get muddled up.

In the end though we succeeded. We are making some final adjustments now for the mounting of the camera, but before long there should be an official link here to the stream!

For now we have the link to our first live stream

Beeleive it or not the UNL Bee lab is responsible for maintaining the bumble bee colony at Schramm. I actually got my first bumble bee sting setting up the colony in 2024. The Beelab also hosts a number of workshops there. I highly reccomend checking the location out, even on your own time. Its a beautiful nature center with lots of educational activities for the little ones. They also have some very cool animals to see. My personal favorite is snap daddy.

In addition to setting up the camera itself, I also created a custom mount for the camera and 3D printed it.
