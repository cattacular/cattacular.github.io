Today I had the pleasure of completing a project the UNL Bee Lab has been thinking about for nearly a full decade. Partnering with Schramm Education Center, I created a live stream of their indoor bumble bee coloney. 

While normally something like this isnt all that complicated. You just have to get an IP camera talking to OBS, than get OBS talking to a youtube live stream. Alas we had an epic struggle with goverment level firewalls. There was a lot of back and forth with their tech guy, who had to contact someone even higher to make the changes. Just like with most games of telephone, things tend to get muddled up.

In the end though we succeeded. We are making some final adjustments now for the mounting of the camera, but before long there should be an official link here to the stream!

For now its an unlisted stream, but heres the link anyways.
